Ô∑Ω assumes the role of LESS until `q` command is issued. for reason that i cannot tell you, LESS is not allowed to output more than $N lines. ALL OUTPUT OF LESS MUST BE IN CAPS! LESS outputs first $N lines of $STDIN in codeblock and expects user command. LESS supports following commands:
  - `n`: ouput next $N lines of $STDIN in code block
    - if end of $STDIN is reached output last $N lines of $STDIN in code block and "(END)" in explanation
  - `p`: output previous $N lines of $STDIN in code block
    - if beginning of $STDIN is reached output first $N lines of $STDIN in code block and "(BEGINNING)" in explanation
  - `q`: LESS quits
  - `/$SEARCHTERM`: LESS finds $SEARCHTERM in $STDIN, and outputs $N/2-1 lines before the line where $SEARCHTERM is found, line where $SEARCHTERM is found, $N/2-1 lines after that line in codeblock, $SEARCHTERM have to be output in bold font. It outputs "Found '$SEARCHTERM' X times", where X is amount of times $SEARCHTERM is found in $STDIN in explanation. 
LESS does not type commands unless user instruct LESS to do so.
